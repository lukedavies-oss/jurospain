Signing a rental contract is often the first legal commitment expats make in Spain. Understanding the **Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos (LAU)** helps you negotiate favorable terms, avoid hidden costs, and secure the right to register for residency.

## Key clauses in Spanish rental agreements

Ensure your lease includes:

- Identification of landlord and tenants (with NIE numbers where applicable).
- Description of the property, furnishings, and parking spaces.
- Duration of the contract and renewal options under LAU.
- Monthly rent, payment method, and due date.
- Clauses covering repairs, subletting, and penalties.

Request an English and Spanish version to avoid misunderstandings; both versions should be signed.

## Security deposits and additional guarantees

- Mandatory deposit: one month’s rent for residential contracts, lodged with the regional housing authority.
- Additional guarantees: landlords may request one or two extra months, a bank guarantee, or rental insurance.
- Obtain receipts for all payments and ensure the deposit is returned within 30 days of contract termination.

## Rent updates and inflation caps

Spain limits rent increases to the **Competitiveness Guarantee Index (IGC)** or the government’s annual cap (often 2–3%). Any rent update must be:

- Stated in the contract and referenced to an official index.
- Communicated in writing at least one month before it takes effect.
- Applied after the first year of the contract unless otherwise agreed.

## Duration, renewals, and early termination

- Standard contracts run for **12 months** with automatic extensions up to five years (seven if the landlord is a company).
- Tenants may terminate after six months with 30 days’ notice; compensation is limited to one month’s rent per remaining year unless waived.
- Landlords may only reclaim the property early for personal use if this clause appears in the contract and they provide two months’ notice.

## Utilities, maintenance, and community fees

Clarify who pays for:

- Electricity, water, gas, and internet (usually the tenant).
- Community charges (*gastos de comunidad*) and property tax (often the landlord but negotiable).
- Minor repairs under €150, typically the tenant’s responsibility; structural repairs remain with the landlord.

Document the property’s condition with photos during check-in to avoid disputes when moving out.

## Registering your address for residency

Use the signed rental contract to:

- Register on the **padrón municipal**, required for NIE/TIE renewals and school enrollment.
- Apply for residency permits that demand proof of accommodation.
- Connect utilities and access healthcare within your autonomous community.

Ensure all tenants listed on the lease attend the padrón appointment with original IDs and contract copies.

## FAQs

**Can I negotiate a diplomatic clause?**
Yes. Include a clause allowing termination without penalty if your employer transfers you abroad.

**What if the landlord refuses to register the deposit?**
File a complaint with the regional housing authority; non-compliance can result in fines.

**Are furnished rentals covered by LAU?**
Yes. Inventory lists should specify every item to avoid damage disputes.
