## SL vs. Autónomo: which is best?

Choose an SL if you plan to:

- Limit personal liability for business debts.
- Share ownership with partners or investors.
- Deduct a wider range of business expenses.
- Draw a salary and dividends with optimal tax planning.

Freelancers with lower revenue may prefer autónomo status initially, then upgrade to an SL once turnover surpasses €60,000–€80,000 per year.

## Pre-incorporation requirements

Before forming the company:

- Obtain NIEs for all shareholders and directors.
- Draft bylaws outlining the corporate purpose, share capital, and governance rules.
- Decide on the company’s registered address and director structure.
- Prepare a share capital contribution of at least **€3,000** (cash or assets).

## Reserving the company name

Submit a **negative name certificate (certificación negativa)** request to the Central Mercantile Registry (RMC):

1. Propose up to five company names.
2. Pay the registry fee and file the request online or via courier.
3. Receive the certificate within 2–3 business days; it is valid for three months.

## Depositing share capital

- Open a Spanish business bank account using shareholder identification and draft bylaws.
- Deposit the minimum €3,000 capital and obtain a **bank certificate** confirming the funds.
- Alternatively, contribute assets and provide an auditor’s valuation report.

## Signing the notary deed

Schedule a notary appointment to sign the **escritura de constitución**:

- Provide the name certificate, bylaws, bank certificate, NIEs, and director acceptance letters.
- Directors sign in person or via power of attorney.
- The notary issues a provisional tax identification code (**CIF provisional**).

## Tax and Social Security registrations

After notarisation:

1. Submit **Modelo 036** to register the company with the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) and obtain the final CIF.
2. Register for VAT (IVA) and corporate tax (IS) obligations.
3. Enroll directors and employees with **Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social**.
4. Activate digital certificates for the company and administrators to handle electronic filings.

## Ongoing compliance obligations

- Maintain proper bookkeeping and file annual accounts with the Mercantile Registry.
- Submit quarterly VAT returns (Modelo 303), annual VAT summary (Modelo 390), and corporate tax return (Modelo 200).
- Hold annual general meetings to approve financial statements.
- Renew digital certificates every two years and keep corporate books updated.

## FAQs

**Can I form an SL remotely?**
Yes. Grant a power of attorney to a Spanish representative and sign documents electronically when allowed by the notary.

**Do I need a Spanish bank account?**
Yes. Share capital must be deposited in a local bank or certified via an asset appraisal.

**How long does incorporation take?**
Expect 2–4 weeks if paperwork is complete and bank compliance checks are satisfied.
