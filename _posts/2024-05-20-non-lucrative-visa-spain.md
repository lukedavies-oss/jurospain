## Who should consider the non-lucrative visa

The non-lucrative visa is ideal for retirees, digital investors, and families seeking to spend extended time in Spain without engaging in local employment. It’s particularly popular with citizens of the US, UK, Canada, and Latin American countries who value Spain’s healthcare, climate, and lower cost of living. Because it prohibits work in Spain, applicants rely on savings, pensions, or passive income streams. If you plan to work remotely for a foreign employer, consider the [digital nomad visa]({{ '/guides/digital-nomad-visa-spain/' | relative_url }}) instead.

## Key eligibility criteria in 2025

To qualify you must:

- Be over 18 with a clean criminal record for the past five years.
- Provide proof of sufficient financial means for yourself and dependants.
- Hold comprehensive private health insurance valid in Spain.
- Have accommodation arranged in Spain (rental contract, property deed, or invitation letter).
- Commit to residing in Spain for more than 183 days per year.
- Not suffer from illnesses posing a public health risk.

Dependants (spouse, partner, children under 21 or dependent adults, and dependent parents) can be included in the application with additional financial proof.

## Income requirements and financial planning

The government uses Spain’s **IPREM** (Public Income Indicator) to calculate minimum income. For 2025, the main applicant must show 400% of IPREM: €2,400 per month or €28,800 annually. Each dependant requires an additional €7,200 per year (100% IPREM).

Demonstrating financial means can involve:

- Bank statements showing consistent balances above the required amount.
- Pension statements or annuity contracts.
- Investment portfolio summaries with dividends or rental income.
- Certified letters from financial institutions confirming access to funds.

Aim to show liquid funds covering at least one year, plus a buffer for currency fluctuations. If your assets are abroad, provide sworn translations and apostilles where applicable.

## Document checklist and translations

Prepare documents carefully; missing details cause delays. Typical requirements include:

- Completed national visa application form and EX-01 form.
- Passport valid for at least one year and copies of every page.
- Two passport-sized photos with white background.
- Proof of financial means as outlined above.
- Private health insurance certificate from a Spanish-authorised insurer, with no co-payments.
- Criminal record certificates from all countries lived in during the past five years, apostilled or legalised.
- Medical certificate declaring you do not suffer from diseases that could pose a serious public health risk.
- Proof of accommodation in Spain (rental contract, property deed, or invitation letter). If renting, provide a contract covering at least 12 months.
- Marriage certificate and birth certificates for dependants, apostilled and translated.
- Payment of the visa fee (varies by consulate; approximately €80–€150).

Each Spanish consulate publishes specific instructions. Some require notarised declarations that you will not work in Spain or demand additional financial evidence. Always follow the consulate’s checklist.

## Applying at the Spanish consulate

1. **Book an appointment.** Slots fill quickly, especially in London, Los Angeles, and Miami. Secure a date at least three months in advance.
2. **Prepare originals and copies.** Most consulates require documents to be presented in duplicate.
3. **Attend the appointment.** Submit your dossier, pay the fee, and answer questions about your plans in Spain. Keep answers consistent with your documentation.
4. **Wait for approval.** Processing usually takes 4–8 weeks. You may receive requests for additional documents.
5. **Collect the visa.** Once approved, the visa is affixed to your passport, typically valid for 90 days to enter Spain. Some consulates issue the initial residence permit simultaneously.

## After arrival: TIE card and empadronamiento

Within 30 days of arriving in Spain, complete these steps:

- **Apply for the TIE card.** Book a fingerprint appointment at the police station with form EX-17, the payment receipt for fee 790-012, your passport, visa, and proof of address.
- **Empadronamiento.** Register with the local town hall to obtain the padrón certificate. This is required for school enrollment, healthcare access, and future renewals. Follow our [empadronamiento guide]({{ '/guides/empadronamiento-spain/' | relative_url }}) for tips.
- **Open a bank account and set up utilities.** Having local banking simplifies rent payments and renewals.

## Renewing your non-lucrative residence

The first residence card is valid for one year. Renewal grants a two-year permit, and the second renewal grants another two years, covering the five-year path to long-term residency. Requirements for renewal include:

- Spending more than 183 days per year in Spain.
- Maintaining private health insurance.
- Demonstrating financial means for two years (double the annual requirement).
- Providing proof of continued accommodation.
- Showing school enrollment for dependent children.

File the renewal 60 days before expiry or within 90 days after, though late submissions incur fines. Processing typically takes 1–3 months. Keep copies of all documents and proof of submission.

## Transitioning to other residence permits

After the first year you may modify the permit to:

- **Work permit (employment).** Requires a job offer and labour market test unless you qualify for an exempt occupation.
- **Self-employed permit (autónomo).** Submit a business plan, financial projections, and proof of investment. See our [autónomo guide]({{ '/guides/register-as-autonomo-spain/' | relative_url }}) for more.
- **Student permit.** If you decide to pursue studies, you can switch without leaving Spain.

Time spent on the non-lucrative permit counts toward permanent residency and citizenship, so plan modifications strategically.

## Common refusal reasons and how to avoid them

- **Insufficient funds.** Provide bank statements covering 6–12 months, not just snapshots. Maintain balances above requirements.
- **Inadequate insurance.** Policies must be fully comprehensive with no co-payments and coverage across Spain.
- **Unclear accommodation.** Present a signed lease or property deed. Hotel bookings rarely suffice.
- **Missing apostilles or translations.** Legalise documents and use sworn translators recognised by Spain.
- **Inconsistent statements.** Ensure your cover letter, application forms, and interview answers align.

If refused, you can appeal within one month or reapply after addressing the reasons. Legal representation helps craft a strong appeal.

## FAQs

### Can I travel outside Spain during the first year?

Yes, but keep trips short to avoid questions about your intention to reside in Spain. For renewals, you must prove you spent more than 183 days per year in the country.

### Does the visa cover adult children?

Yes, if they are financially dependent and full-time students. Provide enrollment letters and evidence of support.

### Do I need to file taxes in Spain?

If you spend more than 183 days per year in Spain, you become a tax resident and must file Spanish tax returns. Work with a tax advisor to plan for worldwide income and potential double taxation treaties.

### How does this visa compare with the Golden Visa?

The [Golden Visa]({{ '/guides/spain-golden-visa/' | relative_url }}) requires a qualifying investment but allows you to work and does not mandate 183 days of residence. The non-lucrative visa requires lower upfront costs but limits work and expects full-time residence.
