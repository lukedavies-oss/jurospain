## When bilingual contracts are required

- Joint ventures or sales involving foreign and Spanish parties.
- Employment agreements with international staff relocating to Spain.
- Investor documents and shareholder agreements for cross-border funding rounds.
- Commercial leases or service agreements where one party prefers English.

Some sectors (consumer finance, insurance) mandate Spanish-language documents; bilingual formats ensure compliance while supporting English-speaking stakeholders.

## Structuring Spanish-English agreements

- Use side-by-side columns or sequential sections, with Spanish typically taking precedence.
- Add a **prevailing language clause** stating which version governs in case of conflict.
- Ensure defined terms are translated consistently throughout the document.
- Maintain identical formatting (numbering, headings) in both languages to avoid ambiguity.

## Key clauses to localise

Translate and adapt:

- Governing law and jurisdiction to Spanish courts or agreed arbitration centres.
- Data protection clauses referencing GDPR and Spain’s LOPDGDD.
- Tax representations covering Spanish VAT/withholding obligations.
- Termination and penalty clauses that comply with Spanish Civil and Commercial Codes.

## Execution and notarisation tips

- Provide the notary with both language versions; some notaries require sworn translations if the foreign party signs only the English version.
- When using powers of attorney, ensure the document authorises signing in both languages.
- Use qualified electronic signatures recognised in the EU for remote execution.

## Maintaining version control

- Store bilingual templates in a contract management system with metadata on governing language.
- Track updates with version numbers and change logs in both Spanish and English.
- Offer employees style guides and approved terminology to keep translations consistent.

## FAQs

**Does the English version have legal standing?**
Yes, if the contract specifies that both versions are equally authoritative or names a prevailing language.

**Do I need a sworn translator?**
Recommended for high-value deals or when filing documents with Spanish authorities.

**Can I issue invoices in English?**
Yes, but VAT descriptions must meet Spanish tax requirements; keep bilingual records for audits.
