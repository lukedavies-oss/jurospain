## Why powers of attorney matter for expats

Buying property, applying for visas, or running a business in Spain often requires in-person signatures at notaries, banks, and government offices. When you can’t travel, a **power of attorney (POA)** lets a trusted representative act on your behalf. With a well-drafted POA, lawyers can sign purchase deeds, collect NIE certificates, open bank accounts, and handle tax filings without delays. It’s a cornerstone of remote relocation management, especially for Golden Visa investors and families balancing commitments in different countries.

## Types of Spanish powers of attorney

Spanish law recognises several POA formats:

- **General power (*poder general*).** Grants broad authority over financial and legal matters. Useful for ongoing administration but requires high trust.
- **Special power (*poder especial*).** Limits authority to specific actions such as buying property, selling a home, or signing a mortgage.
- **Preventive power (*poder preventivo*).** Remains effective if you lose capacity due to illness or accident. Often combined with healthcare directives.
- **Judicial power.** Allows representation in court proceedings, typically granting powers to procuradores and lawyers.

Most expats use special powers tailored to a transaction, ensuring the attorney only performs defined tasks.

## Key elements every power of attorney should include

- **Principal’s details.** Full name, passport number, nationality, marital status, and address.
- **Attorney’s details.** Full name, ID (DNI/NIE/passport), and address.
- **Scope of powers.** Precise list of authorised actions, including signing purchase deeds, mortgages, tax documents, or opening bank accounts.
- **Duration and limitations.** State whether the POA is valid for a specific period or until revoked. Include safeguards such as requiring two attorneys to act jointly.
- **Substitution clause.** Decide if the attorney can delegate powers to someone else. Usually restricted unless necessary.
- **Acceptance of Spanish law.** Clarify that Spanish law governs the POA and that the attorney must present the document to relevant authorities.

## Drafting the document

Work with a bilingual lawyer to draft the POA in Spanish (and English if desired). They ensure terminology aligns with notary standards and references correct legal articles. Typical steps:

1. **Define objectives.** Identify the tasks you want the attorney to handle.
2. **List required clauses.** Include property registry references, bank details, or tax numbers where relevant.
3. **Prepare bilingual text.** Notaries prefer Spanish as the controlling language; English translations provide clarity for the principal.
4. **Review for accuracy.** Confirm personal details and scope. Mistakes cause delays at signing.

If you’re buying property, include clauses authorising the attorney to pay taxes, sign utility contracts, and represent you before the Land Registry. For visa management, authorise the attorney to file applications, collect resolutions, and submit appeals.

## Signing in Spain vs abroad

### Signing in Spain

Visit a Spanish notary with your passport. The notary reads the document aloud, ensures you understand the scope, and records your signature in the protocol. You receive a certified copy (*copia autorizada*) for your attorney.

### Signing abroad

If you can’t travel, sign before a notary in your home country or at the nearest Spanish consulate:

- **Local notary.** Sign the POA, then legalise it with an apostille under the Hague Convention (or consular legalisation if the country isn’t a member).
- **Spanish consulate.** Consulates can notarise the POA directly in Spanish, which simplifies acceptance in Spain. Book appointments well in advance.

After signing abroad, courier the original to Spain for presentation at the notary or registry.

## Using the apostille and sworn translations

Documents signed outside Spain require legalisation:

1. **Apostille.** Obtained from the competent authority in the country where you sign. It certifies the notary’s signature.
2. **Sworn translation.** If the document isn’t in Spanish, a sworn translator registered in Spain must translate it. Provide both the original and translation to authorities.

Some notaries accept bilingual POAs with embedded translations, reducing translation needs. Always confirm requirements with the receiving office.

## Managing risks and safeguards

- **Choose a trustworthy attorney.** Usually a lawyer or close relative. Verify their professional registration.
- **Limit scope.** Authorise only necessary actions and specify property addresses or transaction amounts.
- **Set expiry dates.** Include a validity period (e.g., 12 months) after which the POA automatically lapses.
- **Monitor actions.** Request copies of documents signed under the POA. Maintain a shared digital folder.
- **Use dual signatures.** For high-value transactions, appoint two attorneys who must act jointly.

## Revoking or updating the power

To revoke:

1. Sign a revocation deed before a notary in Spain or abroad (with apostille and translation if outside Spain).
2. Notify the attorney formally, ideally via burofax or notarised letter.
3. Inform banks, registries, and agencies that relied on the POA. Provide them with the revocation deed.
4. If the POA was recorded at the Land Registry, request cancellation there as well.

When updating, execute a new POA and state that it supersedes previous ones. Keep clear records to avoid conflicting powers.

## FAQs

### Can one power cover multiple transactions?

Yes, but keep clauses precise. For example, authorise your attorney to “purchase property at Calle Mayor 10, Madrid, sign the mortgage with Bank X, and handle related tax payments.”

### How long does drafting and signing take?

Drafting usually takes 2–3 days. Signing at a Spanish notary takes about 30 minutes. If signing abroad, factor in apostille processing (3–10 days) and courier time.

### Can I appoint more than one attorney?

Yes. You can allow them to act jointly or separately. Joint powers provide added security but require coordination.

### Do I need to notarise the revocation?

Yes, revocations must be notarised to ensure third parties recognise the change. Always deliver copies to the original attorney and relevant institutions.
