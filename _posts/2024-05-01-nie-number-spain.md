## Overview: NIE vs NIF vs TIE

If you plan to live, work, invest, or buy property in Spain, you will hear several acronyms. The **NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero)** is the foreigner identification number every non-Spanish national uses for almost any official interaction. The **NIF** is the general tax identification number that Spaniards and foreigners share; for foreigners it matches the NIE. Meanwhile, the **TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero)** is the physical residency card issued to non-EU citizens once their stay exceeds 90 days. Think of the NIE as the unique number that unlocks your Spanish life: you need it to sign for utilities, pay taxes, open a bank account, or complete a property purchase.

Unlike the TIE, the NIE is not proof of legal residency. It is purely an identification number that links your identity to Spanish administration systems. EU citizens and non-EU citizens both need it, and you can apply long before relocating. Because the NIE and NIF match, once you receive the NIE you can register with the tax agency or submit returns without additional steps.

## Who needs an NIE number

Anyone who wants to engage in economic, professional, or social activities in Spain will eventually need an NIE. That includes:

- Buyers or sellers of Spanish property.
- Founders or investors in Spanish companies.
- Employees signing Spanish work contracts.
- Remote workers renting long-term accommodation.
- Students opening bank accounts or signing housing agreements.
- Family members applying for residency permits.

Even short-term visitors often benefit from having an NIE because it simplifies opening utilities, buying a car, or paying property taxes. Children need NIE numbers too when they are party to inheritance, property purchases, or long-term residency processes. The only people who can avoid it are tourists staying in hotels for short trips with no financial ties.

## Where to apply: Spain or abroad

You have two routes: applying while you are physically in Spain or through a Spanish consulate abroad. The best route depends on your timeline, your location, and appointment availability.

### Applying inside Spain

If you are already in Spain, you submit your application at a **Comisaría de Policía** or **Oficina de Extranjería** (foreigners’ office). Major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia require an appointment via the *sede electrónica* (online portal). Smaller towns sometimes allow walk-ins, but policies change frequently. Applying in Spain is the fastest way to obtain an NIE when you already have supporting documents, especially if you can secure an appointment.

### Applying from abroad

When you need the NIE to buy property or sign contracts before moving, apply through your nearest Spanish consulate. Consulates in London, Dublin, New York, Miami, Sydney, and many other cities accept NIE applications by appointment. The benefit is you can organise everything before travelling. The trade-off is that each consulate sets its own requirements, and processing may take several weeks because documents travel to Spain for registration.

Whichever path you choose, the underlying documentation and fee remain the same. What changes are the appointment booking method and how you collect the certificate.

## Documents checklist and EX-15 walkthrough

The paperwork looks intimidating but becomes manageable when you break it down. Assemble the following:

1. **Passport and copies.** Bring the original passport plus one or two photocopies of the information page. EU citizens can often use national identity cards.
2. **Completed EX-15 form.** This is the official application form. Fill it in using capital letters; you can complete it in Spanish or English.
3. **Justification letter.** Provide evidence of why you need an NIE, such as a property reservation contract, job offer, company incorporation documents, or a bank letter.
4. **Proof of address.** Some offices request a Spanish address. Temporary accommodation or a hotel booking usually suffices.
5. **Passport-size photos.** Not always required, but bring two recent photos just in case.
6. **Modelo 790 Código 012 fee receipt.** You must pay the administrative fee in advance. More on this below.
7. **Representation authorisation (if applicable).** If someone attends on your behalf, they need a notarised power of attorney and a copy of your passport.

### Completing the EX-15 form

The EX-15 has three sections:

- **Section 1** covers personal information: names, date of birth, country of birth, and parent names. Pay attention to accents and spelling—they must match your passport exactly.
- **Section 2** requests your address and contact information. If you are applying from abroad, enter your home-country address and include an email for communication.
- **Section 3** asks for your reason for applying. Select the most relevant option (economic, professional, social) and briefly describe your situation, e.g., “Compra de vivienda en Madrid”.

Sign and date the form, ensuring the signature matches your passport. Use blue ink if you are printing and signing.

## Paying the Modelo 790 Código 012 fee

Every NIE application requires payment of the **Modelo 790 Código 012** fee. The process is:

1. Visit the official payment website and choose “Asignación de Número de Identidad de Extranjero (NIE)”.
2. Complete the form with your personal details. If you do not yet have an NIE, leave that field blank.
3. Download and print the PDF with three copies.
4. Take the forms to a collaborating bank and pay the fee in cash or by card. As of early 2025 the fee is €9.84, but always verify the current amount.
5. The bank will stamp the forms and return two copies. Keep one for your records and bring one to the appointment.

If you apply via a consulate, you often pay the fee there, either in local currency or via bank draft. Check the consulate’s specific instructions because some require payment days before your appointment.

## Booking the appointment

Appointment availability is the biggest challenge in busy provinces. Tips for success:

- **Check multiple times a day.** New slots appear early in the morning and after cancellations.
- **Use the correct province.** Select the province where you’ll apply, then choose the procedure “Asignación de NIE”.
- **Have details ready.** The portal times out quickly. Prepare your passport number, name, and email in advance.
- **Consider alternative towns.** Nearby cities may have more availability. For example, applicants in Barcelona often secure appointments in Girona or Tarragona.
- **Hire representation.** If timing is critical, a legal representative with authorised access can secure appointments faster.

Consulates usually provide an appointment booking link or email. These slots fill up weeks in advance, so schedule as soon as you know you need the NIE.

## What happens on appointment day

Arrive 15 minutes early with your complete pack. Security will check your ID before entering. Inside, follow these steps:

1. Present your passport, EX-15, justification documents, and fee receipt.
2. Officers may ask simple questions about your reason for applying. Answer succinctly and respectfully.
3. If everything is in order, you receive a stamped copy of the EX-15 or a *resguardo* (receipt) confirming submission.
4. Some offices issue the NIE on the spot. Others ask you to return after a few days or weeks to collect the certificate.

If you gave a power of attorney, your representative signs on your behalf and collects the documentation when ready.

## Receiving your NIE certificate

The final document is the **Certificado de Registro de Ciudadano Extranjero**, a white sheet listing your NIE, full name, date of birth, and nationality. Keep digital and physical copies because banks, notaries, and tax authorities will request it frequently. If issued at a consulate, you may receive the certificate by post or email depending on their policy.

Remember that the NIE does not expire, but the certificate might note the date of issue. Some institutions prefer a certificate issued within the last three months. If yours is older, you can request a duplicate using the same form and fee.

## Troubleshooting common issues

- **No appointments available.** Expand your search to neighbouring towns, work with an immigration lawyer, or apply through a consulate.
- **Justification rejected.** Provide clearer evidence: for a property purchase, include the reservation contract and proof of deposit payment.
- **Incorrect personal details.** Review the certificate immediately. If there’s an error, request a correction on the spot.
- **Lost NIE certificate.** File a duplicate request with the police station where you applied. Bring ID, a new fee receipt, and proof of loss if available.
- **Expired passport.** Some offices refuse to process applications with passports expiring within six months. Renew it before applying.

## Typical timelines and costs

| Step | Typical timeline | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Appointment booking | 1–4 weeks in large cities | Smaller towns often have same-week availability |
| Processing in Spain | Same day to 10 business days | Depends on workload and whether the office prints certificates immediately |
| Consulate processing | 2–6 weeks | Documents travel to Spain for registration |
| Total government fees | €9.84 | Power of attorney or translations incur extra costs |

Professional assistance ranges from €150 to €400 depending on location and urgency. Factor in translation costs for non-Spanish documents and courier fees if you apply from abroad.

## Staying compliant after you receive the NIE

Obtaining the NIE is just the beginning. Next steps include:

- **Opening a Spanish bank account.** Most banks require the NIE certificate. Follow our [bank account guide]({{ '/guides/opening-a-bank-account-spain/' | relative_url }}) for tips.
- **Registering with the town hall.** If you plan to stay long term, complete the [empadronamiento]({{ '/guides/empadronamiento-spain/' | relative_url }}) to access healthcare and schools.
- **Securing the correct visa or residency.** Non-EU nationals must hold the appropriate visa, such as the [digital nomad visa]({{ '/guides/digital-nomad-visa-spain/' | relative_url }}) or [non-lucrative visa]({{ '/guides/non-lucrative-visa-spain/' | relative_url }}).
- **Filing taxes.** Once you spend significant time in Spain or hold assets, consult a tax advisor about your obligations.

Treat the NIE as the key that unlocks these next actions, and keep multiple certified copies for your records.

## FAQs

### Can someone else collect my NIE for me?

Yes. Provide a notarised power of attorney authorising them to act on your behalf. Many clients appoint a representative when they cannot be in Spain for the appointment or collection.

### Do I need a Spanish phone number to book the appointment?

No. The online system accepts international phone numbers. However, having a Spanish number makes it easier to receive SMS notifications from banks and government platforms later on.

### How soon before a property closing should I apply?

Ideally, secure the NIE at least one month before completion. Notaries will not allow you to sign without it, and mortgage banks usually require it when issuing the loan offer.

### Is the NIE the same as a social security number?

No. The social security number (*número de afiliación*) is a separate registration used for employment and healthcare. You obtain it from the Social Security office, often on the same day as your work contract starts.
