## Pre-move planning checklist

Start preparations at least six months before your relocation:

- Confirm visa eligibility for each family member (Digital Nomad, Non-Lucrative, EU family permit, etc.).
- Obtain apostilled birth certificates, marriage certificates, and vaccination records.
- Research housing near schools and public transport.
- Plan for private health insurance coverage until Social Security access is activated.

## Choosing schools in Spain

Spain offers multiple education options:

- **Public schools (colegios públicos):** Free, Spanish-language instruction following national curriculum.
- **Concertado schools:** Semi-private institutions with subsidised tuition and bilingual programs.
- **International schools:** Offer IB, British, American, or other curricula; ideal for short-term assignments.

Evaluate academic calendars, language support, and extracurricular activities to find the best fit.

## Enrolling children in public and private schools

- Registration typically opens between March and May for the following academic year.
- Provide NIEs or passport copies, empadronamiento certificate, vaccination records, and previous school transcripts.
- Apply through your local education authority (*Consejería de Educación*) or directly with private schools.
- Expect placement results in late June; confirm attendance to secure the spot.

## Healthcare registration for families

- Secure private health insurance that covers each family member with zero co-payments for visa applications.
- After arrival, obtain Social Security numbers and register at the local **centro de salud**.
- Request individual **Tarjetas Sanitarias** and choose a pediatrician or family doctor.
- Keep vaccination schedules updated in both the Spanish and home-country systems.

## Residency cards for spouses and dependants

- Schedule **TIE** appointments for non-EU family members within 30 days of arrival.
- Submit passports, visa stamps, empadronamiento, proof of relationship, and proof of financial means.
- Biometric appointments require payment of the **Modelo 790 Código 012** fee in advance.
- EU citizens bringing non-EU spouses should file for the **Tarjeta de Familiar de Ciudadano de la Unión**.

## Integrating into the community

- Join local parent associations (*AMPAs*) to access school updates and activities.
- Enroll children in sports clubs or language classes to build friendships quickly.
- Participate in neighbourhood events and cultural festivals to learn regional customs.
- Consider language exchange groups to improve Spanish proficiency as a family.

## FAQs

**Can children attend school without a NIE?**
Schools can temporarily accept passports while NIE applications are pending, but you must supply the NIE once issued.

**Do dependants need private insurance after registering for Social Security?**
Coverage extends to dependants linked to your Social Security account, but maintain private policies until the public system is active.

**How long do TIE cards take to arrive?**
Cards are typically ready within 30–45 days after biometrics; pick them up in person with original passports.
