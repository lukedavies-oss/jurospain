## What is the Non-Lucrative Visa?

Spain's Non-Lucrative Visa (often called the retirement visa or financially independent visa) allows non-EU citizens to live in Spain without working. It's designed for retirees, early retirees, and financially independent individuals who can support themselves through pensions, investments, savings, or other passive income sources.

The visa grants initial residency for one year, renewable for two-year periods. After five years of legal residence, you become eligible for permanent residency, and after ten years you can apply for Spanish citizenship if you meet language and integration requirements.

Unlike work visas or the Digital Nomad Visa, the Non-Lucrative Visa strictly prohibits any employment or professional activity in Spain. You cannot work for Spanish companies, provide services to Spanish clients, or engage in any business activities. However, you can receive income from sources outside Spain—pensions, rental properties, dividends, interest, and annuities—without restriction.

This visa became increasingly popular after the Golden Visa ended in April 2025, as it offers a straightforward path to Spanish residency for those with sufficient financial means. Americans, Canadians, Brits, Australians, and other nationalities commonly use this route to retire in Spain's sunny climate.

Key benefits include:

- Legal residence in Spain without needing employment.
- Access to Spanish healthcare after obtaining residency.
- Freedom to travel throughout the Schengen Area.
- Ability to bring family members (spouse and dependent children).
- Pathway to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.
- No minimum investment requirements (unlike the former Golden Visa).

## Who should apply for this visa

The Non-Lucrative Visa suits several profiles:

### Retirees

Whether you're 55 or 75, if you have a pension, retirement savings, or investment income sufficient to meet the financial thresholds, this visa offers a perfect route to Spanish living. Many northern European and North American retirees choose Spain for its warm climate, affordable healthcare, and relaxed lifestyle.

### Early retirees

Left the workforce at 50? Have investment portfolios generating passive income? The Non-Lucrative Visa doesn't require you to be retirement age—just financially independent. Early retirees from tech, finance, and entrepreneurial backgrounds frequently use this visa.

### Financially independent individuals

Perhaps you sold a business, inherited wealth, or built substantial investment portfolios. As long as your passive income meets the thresholds and you're content not working in Spain, this visa works perfectly.

### Trailing spouses

If your partner has Spanish residency through work or study and you don't plan to work yourself, the Non-Lucrative Visa provides an independent residency path. Alternatively, you could qualify under family reunification, depending on your situation.

### Who should NOT apply

- Anyone planning to work or run a business in Spain (consider work visas or entrepreneur visas instead).
- Remote workers employed by foreign companies (the Digital Nomad Visa is more appropriate).
- Individuals whose only income source is employment (you cannot maintain work income while on this visa).

## Income and financial requirements for 2026

Financial requirements are the heart of the Non-Lucrative Visa application. Spanish immigration authorities want assurance you can support yourself without working or accessing public assistance.

### Minimum monthly income

For 2026, the requirements are based on Spain's IPREM (Public Income Indicator), which adjusts annually for inflation. The IPREM for 2025 was €600 per month, and assuming modest inflation, expect 2026 requirements around:

- **Main applicant**: €2,400 per month (€28,800 annually) — 400% of IPREM.
- **Spouse**: Additional €600 per month (€7,200 annually) — 100% of IPREM.
- **Each dependent child**: Additional €600 per month (€7,200 annually) — 100% of IPREM.

**Example calculations**:

- Single person: €28,800 annually.
- Couple: €36,000 annually (€28,800 + €7,200).
- Couple with two children: €50,400 annually (€28,800 + €7,200 + €7,200 + €7,200).

### Savings requirement

Beyond monthly income, you must prove savings to cover three years of expenses at the required income level:

- Single person: €86,400 (€28,800 × 3).
- Couple: €108,000 (€36,000 × 3).
- Family of four: €151,200 (€50,400 × 3).

These savings must be liquid or easily accessible—bank accounts, investment portfolios, or money market funds. Property equity or illiquid assets don't count toward this requirement.

### Combining income and savings

Spanish consulates allow you to combine income and savings to meet requirements. For example:

- If you have €1,800 monthly income (€21,600 annually), you're €7,200 short of the €28,800 requirement.
- You could make up the difference with additional savings: €21,600 in accessible funds beyond the three-year requirement.

Your consulate will provide specific guidance on acceptable combinations during your application process.

## Acceptable income sources

Not all income qualifies. Spain distinguishes between passive income (allowed) and active work income (prohibited).

### Acceptable sources

**Pensions**: Government or private pensions from your home country are ideal. Include documentation from pension providers showing monthly amounts and payment continuity.

**Investment income**: Dividends, capital gains, interest from bonds, and distributions from investment accounts qualify. Provide brokerage statements showing regular income.

**Rental income**: If you own rental properties abroad, net rental income (after expenses) counts. Include lease agreements, bank statements showing rent deposits, and tax returns declaring rental income.

**Annuities**: Fixed or variable annuities purchased from insurance companies qualify if they provide regular, guaranteed payments.

**Trust distributions**: If you're a beneficiary of a trust providing regular income, include trust documents and distribution statements.

**Savings and assets**: While not income per se, demonstrating substantial savings shows financial capacity and can supplement income shortfalls.

### Unacceptable sources

**Employment income**: Salary or wages from any job, whether in your home country or elsewhere, don't qualify because the visa assumes you'll cease working.

**Freelance or consulting income**: Payments for services, even if performed remotely, are considered work income and are prohibited.

**Business profits**: If you actively manage a business, profits from that business may not qualify unless you can prove the business operates entirely without your involvement.

The distinction is sometimes grey. For example, if you own rental properties but use property management companies to handle all operations, that's passive income. If you actively manage properties yourself, it may be considered work. Consult with an immigration lawyer if your situation is ambiguous.

## Healthcare requirements

Private health insurance is mandatory for Non-Lucrative Visa applicants. Spain's public healthcare system is not accessible to Non-Lucrative Visa holders initially (though you can access it after one year of residence by paying into the healthcare system voluntarily).

### Insurance specifications

Your policy must:

- Provide comprehensive coverage in Spain with no copays.
- Cover all medical needs, including hospitalization, surgeries, prescriptions, and emergency care.
- Be valid for at least one year from your visa start date.
- Be from a Spanish insurance company or a foreign insurer authorized to operate in Spain.
- Include a certificate in Spanish stating the coverage terms.

### Cost

Expect to pay €50-150 per month per person depending on age and coverage level. Older applicants (60+) face higher premiums, sometimes reaching €200-300 monthly.

### Recommended providers

Popular insurers for expats include:

- **Sanitas**: Wide network, English-speaking support, €60-200/month.
- **Adeslas**: Extensive coverage, good for families, €70-180/month.
- **Asisa**: Competitive rates, strong in major cities, €50-150/month.
- **DKV**: International insurer with expat expertise, €80-200/month.

Purchase insurance before your consulate appointment, as you'll need the policy certificate for your application.

### After one year

Once you've been a resident for one year, you can voluntarily enroll in Spain's public healthcare system by paying a monthly fee (approximately €60-80 for those under 65, higher for older ages). This often provides better value than private insurance and gives you access to the excellent Spanish public health network.

## Complete document checklist

Gather these documents before scheduling your consulate appointment:

### Essential documents

1. **Completed visa application form**: National visa application (solicitud de visado nacional). Available from your Spanish consulate's website.

2. **Passport**: Valid for at least one year beyond your intended entry date, with at least two blank pages. Include photocopies of all pages.

3. **Passport photos**: Two recent color photos meeting biometric standards (35-40mm size, white background, frontal, no glasses).

4. **Criminal record certificate**: From your home country and any country where you've lived more than six months in the past five years. Must be apostilled and dated within three months of application. Translated into Spanish by official translator.

5. **Medical certificate**: From a licensed physician stating you're in good health and free from diseases with quarantine implications. Must be dated within three months of application, apostilled, and translated.

6. **Private health insurance**: Policy certificate in Spanish showing comprehensive coverage and no copays.

7. **Proof of income and savings**: Bank statements for the last six months, pension letters, investment account statements, property deeds for rental properties, and tax returns for the past two years. All apostilled and translated.

8. **Bank solvency certificate**: Official letter from your bank confirming account balances and good standing.

9. **Proof of accommodation**: Rental contract, property deed, or hotel booking in Spain for at least three months. If renting, include a letter from the property owner.

10. **Motivation letter**: One-page letter (in Spanish or English) explaining why you want to move to Spain and how you'll support yourself.

11. **Marriage certificate** (if applicable): Apostilled and translated.

12. **Birth certificates** (for dependent children): Apostilled and translated.

13. **Visa fee payment**: €60-160 depending on consulate. Some require payment at appointment; others require pre-payment.

### Additional documents some consulates request

- **Detailed financial plan**: Spreadsheet showing monthly income, expected expenses in Spain, and savings.
- **Property ownership documents**: If you own property abroad, provide deeds demonstrating assets.
- **Curriculum Vitae**: Some consulates request a CV even though you're not working.
- **Letter of intent**: More detailed version of the motivation letter, sometimes 2-3 pages.

Consulate requirements vary slightly. Check your specific consulate's website or call to confirm the exact list.

## Application process step-by-step

### Step 1: Confirm eligibility

Review the financial requirements carefully and ensure your income and savings exceed the thresholds. If borderline, don't apply yet—build more savings or increase passive income first.

### Step 2: Choose your consulate

Apply at the Spanish consulate with jurisdiction over your legal residence. If you live in California, you'll apply in San Francisco or Los Angeles. New York residents use the New York consulate, and so on.

### Step 3: Gather documents

Allow at least two to three months to collect everything, especially criminal records and apostilles, which take time. Organize documents in the order listed on your consulate's checklist.

### Step 4: Purchase health insurance

Buy your policy once you have a tentative timeline. Most insurers require you to specify a start date, so coordinate this with your expected visa approval and travel dates.

### Step 5: Book your consulate appointment

Appointment slots fill quickly, sometimes months in advance. Book as soon as your documents are ready. Many consulates use online booking systems.

### Step 6: Attend the appointment

Arrive 15 minutes early with all original documents plus copies. Consular officers will:

- Review your documents for completeness.
- Ask questions about your financial situation and plans in Spain.
- Take your biometric data (photo and fingerprints).
- Collect the visa fee.

Be prepared to explain gaps in documentation or inconsistencies. Answer honestly and confidently.

### Step 7: Await processing

Processing takes 30-90 days, sometimes longer during busy periods. The consulate may email you requesting clarifications or additional documents—respond immediately to avoid further delays.

You can usually check status online through your consulate's tracking portal using your application reference number.

### Step 8: Collect your visa

Once approved, you'll receive notification to collect your passport with the visa sticker. The initial visa allows entry to Spain within 90 days of issuance.

### Step 9: Enter Spain and activate your visa

Travel to Spain within the 90-day window. Upon entry, your one-year residence period begins.

## Processing times and costs

| Item | Timeline/Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Document gathering | 2-3 months |
| Consulate appointment wait | 3-8 weeks |
| Visa processing | 30-90 days |
| Total timeline | 4-6 months |
| Visa fee | €60-160 |
| Health insurance | €600-1,800 annually |
| Translations and apostilles | €500-1,000 |
| Medical certificates | €50-150 |
| Legal assistance (optional) | €1,000-3,000 |
| **Estimated total cost** | **€2,200-6,000** |

Plan accordingly. Many applicants start the process six to nine months before their intended move to Spain.

## After arrival: registering in Spain

Once in Spain, you have 30 days to complete several registrations:

### Step 1: Apply for your TIE card

Schedule an appointment at the Oficina de Extranjería (foreigners' office) or police station in your city to apply for your TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero). This physical residence card proves your legal status.

Bring:

- Passport and visa.
- Completed EX-17 application form.
- Three passport photos.
- Proof of address (rental contract or utility bill).
- Fee payment (approximately €12).

Processing takes 30-45 days. You'll receive notification to collect your TIE card, which is valid for one year matching your initial visa period.

### Step 2: Register at the town hall (empadronamiento)

Visit your local ayuntamiento (town hall) to register your address. This empadronamiento certificate is essential for accessing services, enrolling children in schools, and future visa renewals.

You'll need:

- Passport and TIE card.
- Rental contract or property deed.
- Completed registration form (available at the town hall).

Registration is usually instant, and you'll receive a certificate on the spot. For more details, see our [empadronamiento guide]({{ '/guides/empadronamiento-spain/' | relative_url }}).

### Step 3: Obtain your NIE

If you don't already have an NIE (foreigner identification number), you'll receive it when you get your TIE. The NIE is a permanent number used for all official transactions—banking, taxes, property purchases, and more. Keep it safe.

### Step 4: Open a Spanish bank account

With your NIE and proof of address, open a local bank account for paying rent, utilities, and receiving pension transfers if needed. Major banks like BBVA, Santander, and CaixaBank have English-speaking staff and expat services.

## Tax implications and planning

Spanish tax residency has significant implications for your worldwide income.

### Tax residency rules

You become a Spanish tax resident if:

- You spend more than 183 days per year in Spain.
- Spain becomes your center of economic interests (e.g., your family lives there or most assets are there).

As a tax resident, you must report and pay Spanish income tax on your worldwide income—pensions, investment income, rental income, capital gains—at progressive rates from 19% to 47% depending on total income.

### Non-resident tax status

If you spend fewer than 183 days per year in Spain, you remain a non-resident for tax purposes and only pay Spanish tax on Spanish-source income. However, maintaining non-resident status may jeopardize visa renewals, which require evidence of actual residence.

### Income tax rates for residents

Spain taxes income progressively:

- €0-12,450: 19%
- €12,450-20,200: 24%
- €20,200-35,200: 30%
- €35,200-60,000: 37%
- €60,000-300,000: 45%
- €300,000+: 47%

Regional governments add additional taxes, so effective rates vary by region. Madrid has the lowest overall tax burden for residents.

### Pension taxation

Foreign pensions are generally taxable in Spain under most tax treaties, though specific treaties may allow your home country to retain partial or full taxing rights. For example, US Social Security benefits are typically only taxed in the US under the US-Spain tax treaty, while private pension income is taxed in Spain.

### Investment income

Dividends and interest face special rates:

- €0-6,000: 19%
- €6,000-50,000: 21%
- €50,000-200,000: 23%
- €200,000+: 26%

Capital gains follow the same schedule. Spain taxes worldwide investment income for residents.

### Wealth tax

Some regions impose wealth tax on assets exceeding certain thresholds (typically €700,000-1 million). Madrid and Andalusia have eliminated wealth tax, making them attractive for wealthier retirees.

### Double taxation treaties

Spain has tax treaties with most countries to prevent double taxation. These treaties assign taxing rights and provide credits for taxes paid in one country against liabilities in the other. Work with a cross-border tax advisor to optimize your situation and ensure compliance in both countries.

### Tax planning tips

- Consider regional variations—Madrid's lower taxes may save you thousands annually.
- Time your move to minimize income in your first partial tax year.
- Structure investment portfolios tax-efficiently (e.g., growth stocks over dividend-paying stocks if you're in high brackets).
- Take advantage of allowances and deductions available to retirees in Spain.

## Bringing family members

Your spouse and dependent children can accompany you under the Non-Lucrative Visa.

### Spouse

Your legally married spouse or registered civil partner qualifies as a dependent. You must prove:

- Marriage certificate (apostilled and translated).
- Financial capacity to support them (additional €7,200 annually in income or savings).
- Health insurance for them.

Unmarried partners face more complex requirements. Some regions recognize de facto unions, while others don't. Consult your consulate about specific rules.

### Children

Dependent children under 18 automatically qualify. Children ages 18-21 (sometimes up to 25) may qualify if they're unmarried, financially dependent, and enrolled in education.

Requirements:

- Birth certificates (apostilled and translated).
- Financial capacity (additional €7,200 per child).
- Health insurance for each child.
- School enrollment documents (for children 18+).

### Application options

Family members can apply simultaneously with you at the same consulate appointment, or they can apply separately after you're established in Spain through family reunification procedures. Simultaneous applications are simpler and faster.

### Children's education

Public schools in Spain are free and provide excellent education, though instruction is primarily in Spanish (and regional languages like Catalan or Basque). International schools offer English-language education but cost €8,000-20,000 per child annually depending on location and school.

## Renewal requirements

Your initial one-year visa must be renewed in Spain to continue living there legally.

### First renewal

Apply 60 days before your visa expires at the Oficina de Extranjería in your Spanish city. You'll need:

- Proof of continued income meeting the financial thresholds.
- Updated bank statements showing savings.
- Active health insurance certificate.
- Proof of residence in Spain (empadronamiento certificate, rental contract).
- Proof you've spent at least 183 days in Spain during the past year (this is crucial).
- Clean criminal record (if requested).

If everything is in order, you'll receive a two-year renewal. Processing takes 30-90 days, during which your current status remains valid.

### Subsequent renewals

After the first two-year renewal, subsequent renewals follow the same pattern: apply 60 days before expiration, prove continued financial capacity and residence, and receive another two-year extension.

### Common renewal challenges

- **Insufficient time in Spain**: Immigration authorities may deny renewal if you spent less than 183 days per year in Spain, as this suggests you're not genuinely residing there.
- **Income drop**: If your income falls below required thresholds, provide explanations and additional savings to compensate.
- **Insurance gaps**: Maintain continuous coverage. Lapses raise red flags.

Keep meticulous records of your time in Spain—flight bookings, utility bills, bank statements—to prove physical residence.

## Path to permanent residency and citizenship

After five years of continuous legal residence, you can apply for permanent residency (residencia de larga duración).

### Permanent residency benefits

- No renewal requirements—residency becomes indefinite.
- Freedom to work without restrictions.
- Leave Spain for up to 12 months without losing status.
- Nearly equal rights to Spanish citizens except voting in national elections.

### Requirements

- Five years of legal residence on the Non-Lucrative Visa (or any legal residence status).
- Proof of income or employment.
- Clean criminal record.
- Basic Spanish language proficiency (DELE A2 level).
- Pass the CCSE exam (Conocimientos Constitucionales y Socioculturales de España), testing knowledge of Spanish culture, history, and constitution.

### Spanish citizenship

After ten years of legal residence (five years for certain nationalities like Latin Americans), you can apply for citizenship, which requires:

- Higher language proficiency (DELE B2 level as of 2026).
- Passing a more advanced CCSE exam.
- Renunciation of other citizenships (with exceptions for Latin American and certain other countries).
- Good civic conduct and integration.

Spanish citizenship grants full rights, including voting, holding public office, and an EU passport offering visa-free travel to 190+ countries.

## Common mistakes and how to avoid them

### Mistake 1: Underestimating expenses

Many applicants meet income requirements on paper but struggle with Spain's actual cost of living, especially in expensive cities. Create realistic budgets including rent, utilities, healthcare, dining out, and travel before committing.

### Mistake 2: Working remotely

Some visa holders assume they can quietly work remotely for foreign employers. This violates the visa conditions and risks non-renewal or deportation. If you need to work, apply for the Digital Nomad Visa instead.

### Mistake 3: Spending too little time in Spain

Treating the visa as a "golden ticket" while spending most time elsewhere backfires at renewal. Immigration requires genuine residence—at least 183 days annually, documented through utility bills, bank transactions, and flight records.

### Mistake 4: Insufficient documentation

Incomplete applications face delays or rejections. Double-check consulate requirements, ensure every document is properly apostilled and translated, and provide more evidence than minimally required.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring healthcare continuity

Letting private insurance lapse—even briefly—creates problems at renewal. Maintain continuous coverage and keep certificates proving it.

### Mistake 6: Tax non-compliance

Failing to file Spanish tax returns as a resident invites penalties and jeopardizes renewals. Register with the tax agency (Agencia Tributaria) and file annual returns, even if you owe little or no tax.

### Mistake 7: Poor financial planning

Relying on currency exchange rates, investment returns, or property rental income without buffers is risky. Build cushions into your financial plan to handle market volatility or unexpected expenses.

## FAQs

### Can I buy property in Spain on a Non-Lucrative Visa?

Yes. Property ownership is separate from visa status. You can buy property before, during, or after obtaining the visa, and owning property strengthens your renewal applications by demonstrating ties to Spain.

### Can my spouse work if I have a Non-Lucrative Visa?

No. Dependents on your visa face the same work prohibition. If your spouse wants to work, they must apply for a separate work visa or entrepreneur visa independently.

### What happens if I need to leave Spain for extended periods?

Short absences (under 90 days) are fine, but extended absences jeopardize renewals. If you need to be abroad for health, family, or other reasons, document everything and consult an immigration lawyer about maintaining your status.

### Can I convert a Non-Lucrative Visa to a work visa later?

Not directly. You'd need to leave Spain, return to your home country, and apply for a work visa through a consulate. However, after permanent residency (five years), you can work freely without needing a separate work authorization.

### Is the Non-Lucrative Visa the same as the Golden Visa?

No. The Golden Visa required a €500,000 property investment and granted residency automatically. It ended in April 2025. The Non-Lucrative Visa requires no investment—just proof of passive income—but prohibits working.
