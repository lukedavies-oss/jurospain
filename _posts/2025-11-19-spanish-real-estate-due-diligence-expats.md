## Reviewing property ownership

- Obtain a **nota simple** from the Land Registry (*Registro de la Propiedad*) to confirm the owner, plot size, and charges.
- Match registry details with cadastral information (*referencia catastral*).
- Verify that sellers with joint ownership or marital property share have authorisation to sell.

## Checking debts and encumbrances

- Review outstanding mortgages, liens, or embargoes listed in the nota simple.
- Request certificates showing the seller is current on **IBI** property tax and community fees.
- Confirm utility bills are up to date to avoid inheriting arrears.

## Confirming licences and habitability

- Ensure the property has a valid **licencia de primera ocupación** or occupancy certificate.
- For renovations or rural properties, verify planning permissions and energy certificates.
- Short-term rental investors should check local tourist licence rules before completing the purchase.

## Inspecting community and utility costs

- Ask the homeowners’ association for meeting minutes and budgets to evaluate upcoming assessments.
- Review energy performance certificates and request average utility bills.
- Inspect shared facilities (pools, lifts, garages) for maintenance issues.

## Preparing contracts and deposits

- Use a bilingual **contrato de arras** (reservation contract) specifying price, completion date, and penalties.
- Deposit typically 10% of the purchase price; clarify if it is a forfeitable or refundable deposit.
- Include clauses covering mortgage approval, licence verification, and furniture inventories.

## Closing at the notary

- Arrange a power of attorney if you cannot attend the notary appointment in person.
- Provide bank drafts, NIEs, and proof of funds for anti-money laundering checks.
- The notary records the deed (*escritura pública*); register it promptly to update ownership.
- Pay transfer taxes (ITP or VAT/Stamp Duty) within the statutory deadlines.

## FAQs

**Can I rely on the seller’s lawyer?**
Hire independent counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure unbiased due diligence.

**Do I need a bank account in Spain before completion?**
Yes, most notaries require funds to originate from a Spanish account for transparency.

**What if the property has unregistered extensions?**
Regularise additions with the town hall before completion or negotiate a price reduction.
