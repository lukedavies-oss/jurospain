Understanding when you become a tax resident in Spain is essential to avoid double taxation and ensure compliance. Spanish law relies on both the 183-day rule and the concept of “centre of vital interests.”

This guide explains the thresholds, tie-breaker rules, Beckham regime, and practical examples for remote workers, retirees, and property owners.

## Tax residency tests

You are considered a Spanish tax resident if:

- You spend more than 183 days in Spain during a calendar year, or
- Your main economic or family interests are located in Spain (for example, your spouse or dependent children live here).

Residency is determined by physical presence and connections, not visa type.

## The 183-day rule explained

Days count even if you travel briefly abroad unless you can prove tax residency elsewhere. The Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) often checks supporting evidence such as:

- Utility bills
- Mobile phone records
- Social media activity
- School attendance of dependants

Maintain detailed travel logs and keep supporting documentation if you intend to claim non-residency.

## Centre of economic interests

You may become tax resident even without 183 days in Spain if:

- You operate a business, manage assets, or generate most of your income in Spain.
- Your spouse or children habitually reside in Spain.

These criteria frequently affect remote workers and property investors.

## Beckham Law regime

The Special Expatriate Tax Regime (commonly called **Ley Beckham**) allows qualifying newcomers to pay a flat 24% tax on Spanish income up to €600,000 and exclude most foreign income for six years.

To qualify you must:

- Move to Spain for employment or self-employment.
- Not have been a Spanish tax resident in the previous five years.
- Apply within six months of joining Spanish Social Security.

The regime suits digital nomads, executives, and entrepreneurs relocating under employment contracts.

## Double taxation agreements

Spain has treaties with over 90 countries to prevent income from being taxed twice. Generally:

- Tax paid abroad is credited against your Spanish liability.
- Tie-breaker rules (based on the OECD model) resolve residency disputes — typically considering permanent home, centre of interests, habitual abode, and nationality.

## Practical examples

- **UK retiree with property in Spain:** spends 9 months per year in Málaga → tax resident and must declare global income.
- **US remote worker:** spends 5 months in Spain and 7 abroad with an employer outside Spain → non-resident but must declare Spanish-source income.
- **Entrepreneur in Valencia with family in Spain:** resident even when travelling extensively for business.

## Compliance and filings

Key forms include:

- **Modelo 100:** annual income tax return.
- **Modelo 720:** declaration of foreign assets over €50,000.
- **Modelo 210:** non-resident income tax (for property owners).

Late filings can incur heavy penalties, so partner with a bilingual tax advisor to maintain compliance.

## FAQs

**Do I pay tax in Spain if I live there under 183 days?**  
Only if Spain is determined to be your main economic centre.

**Can I be tax resident in two countries?**  
Yes, but treaties determine a single country for tax purposes via tie-breaker rules.

**Can Beckham Law apply to freelancers?**  
Yes, if you register as autónomo while working for a foreign employer under contract.
