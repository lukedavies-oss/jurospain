## What is Spain's Digital Nomad Visa?

Spain's Digital Nomad Visa allows remote workers to live in Spain legally while working for employers or clients based outside of Spain. Introduced in early 2023, the visa targets professionals in the growing remote work economy who want to enjoy Spain's climate, culture, and quality of life without needing Spanish employment.

Unlike tourist visas that limit stays to 90 days, the Digital Nomad Visa grants legal residency for one year initially, renewable for up to five years total. You can work remotely, rent accommodation, access healthcare, and even apply for permanent residency after five years if you meet the requirements.

The visa emerged from Spain's "Startups Law" (Law 28/2022), designed to attract international talent and innovation. It competes directly with Portugal's D7 and D8 visas, Estonia's Digital Nomad Visa, and similar programs across Europe.

Key benefits include:

- Legal residence in Spain for up to five years.
- Freedom to work remotely for non-Spanish companies.
- Ability to travel throughout the Schengen Area.
- Access to Spanish healthcare and services.
- Potential tax benefits under the Beckham Law.
- Pathway to permanent residency and citizenship.

For Americans, Canadians, Australians, Brits, and other remote workers earning stable income, this visa offers an attractive route to European living in 2026.

## Who qualifies for the Digital Nomad Visa

Not everyone working remotely qualifies. Spanish immigration requires you to meet specific criteria:

### Employment status

You must work remotely for companies or clients located primarily outside Spain. This includes:

- **Employees** of foreign companies who work remotely 100% of the time.
- **Freelancers** serving international clients with contracts or regular invoices.
- **Business owners** managing companies registered abroad.
- **Contractors** providing services to multiple international clients.

The critical rule: Spanish-based work cannot exceed 20% of your total annual income. If you earn €50,000 per year, no more than €10,000 can come from Spanish clients or Spanish companies.

### Income threshold

You must prove stable, recurring income meeting these minimums:

- **Single applicant**: €2,400 per month (€28,800 annually).
- **Couple**: €3,000 per month (€36,000 annually).
- **Family with two children**: €3,600 per month (€43,200 annually).
- **Each additional dependent**: add €600 per month.

These figures are based on 200% of Spain's IPREM (Public Income Indicator), which adjusts annually for inflation. For 2026, verify the current IPREM rate when preparing your application, as it typically increases slightly each year.

### Professional experience

Spain prefers applicants with established remote work history. While not explicitly required, demonstrating at least one year of remote work experience strengthens your application. Provide:

- Employment contracts showing remote work arrangements.
- Client testimonials or recommendation letters.
- Portfolio of work demonstrating expertise.
- Tax returns or financial statements showing consistent income.

### Clean background

Like all Spanish residence permits, you need a clean criminal record from your home country and any country where you've lived for more than six months in the past five years.

## Income requirements and proof

Proving stable income is the most scrutinized part of your application. Spanish consulates require concrete evidence that you can support yourself without working in Spain illegally.

### Acceptable income sources

- **Employment contracts**: Full-time or part-time contracts with foreign employers specifying remote work arrangements and monthly salary.
- **Freelance contracts**: Ongoing agreements with multiple clients demonstrating regular income.
- **Bank statements**: Three to six months of statements showing consistent deposits matching your declared income.
- **Tax returns**: Previous year's tax returns proving income history.
- **Company financial statements**: If you own a business, provide profit and loss statements.
- **Investment income**: Dividends, rental income, or interest from investments (combined with active work).

### What doesn't qualify

- Irregular or sporadic income without clear patterns.
- Promises of future earnings without established history.
- Income dependent on physical presence in a specific location.
- Primarily Spanish-source income.

### How to document income

1. **Employment letter**: If employed, request a letter from your employer confirming your position, salary, remote work authorization, and contract duration. Have it translated and apostilled.

2. **Bank certificates**: Obtain official bank certificates (not just printouts) showing account balances and transaction history for the past six months. Highlight incoming deposits matching your claimed income.

3. **Client contracts**: Freelancers should gather at least three significant client contracts demonstrating ongoing relationships and expected income.

4. **Tax returns**: Submit the most recent tax return from your home country, translated and apostilled, showing income above the Spanish threshold.

5. **Professional credentials**: Include diplomas, certifications, LinkedIn profile, or portfolio demonstrating your professional capacity to earn the stated income remotely.

## Eligible work activities

Spain welcomes digital workers across industries, but certain professions are particularly well-suited:

### Tech and IT
Software developers, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, system administrators, and IT consultants.

### Creative professionals
Graphic designers, content writers, video editors, photographers, marketing specialists, and social media managers.

### Business services
Consultants, project managers, business analysts, accountants, and financial advisors serving international clients.

### Education and coaching
Online teachers, tutors, corporate trainers, life coaches, and language instructors.

### Healthcare
Telemedicine providers, medical consultants, and health coaches operating virtually.

The key is proving your work can be performed remotely and doesn't require physical presence in your home country or Spain. Traditional roles tied to specific locations—like retail management or on-site construction—don't qualify.

## Documents checklist

Gather these documents before starting your application:

1. **Passport and copies**: Valid for at least one year beyond your intended stay date. Include photocopies of all pages with stamps or visas.

2. **NIE application**: You'll need a Spanish NIE for tax and identification purposes. Some consulates issue it with the visa; others require separate application. Follow our [NIE guide]({{ '/guides/nie-number-spain/' | relative_url }}).

3. **Completed visa application form**: The official EX-14 form, available from the Spanish consulate or online portal.

4. **Passport photos**: Two recent color photos meeting biometric standards (white background, frontal view, no glasses).

5. **Proof of income**: Employment letters, contracts, bank statements, and tax returns as detailed above.

6. **Criminal record certificate**: From your home country and any country where you've resided over six months in the past five years. Must be apostilled and translated.

7. **Private health insurance**: Coverage must be comprehensive and valid in Spain. Public-sector insurance from your home country typically doesn't qualify. Budget €50-150 per month for private insurance.

8. **Proof of accommodation**: Lease agreement, hotel booking, or property deed showing where you'll live in Spain. A three-month booking usually suffices for initial applications.

9. **Bank solvency proof**: Bank certificate showing sufficient funds beyond monthly income. Some consulates request €10,000-15,000 in savings.

10. **Professional credentials**: Degrees, certifications, or portfolio demonstrating your professional qualifications.

11. **Motivation letter**: One-page letter explaining why you want to live in Spain and how you'll contribute professionally and culturally.

All foreign documents must be apostilled and officially translated into Spanish by a sworn translator (traductor jurado). Budget €50-100 per document for translation costs.

## Step-by-step application process

### Step 1: Confirm eligibility

Review the requirements carefully. Use the checklist above to ensure you qualify before investing time and money in the application.

### Step 2: Gather documents

Allow at least two months to collect everything. Ordering criminal records, obtaining apostilles, and scheduling translations take time.

### Step 3: Book consulate appointment

Contact the Spanish consulate in your jurisdiction. Appointments for residence visas often fill weeks in advance. Most consulates require online booking through their specific portals.

### Step 4: Attend the appointment

Arrive 15 minutes early with all original documents and copies organized in a folder. Consular officers may ask questions about your work, income, and plans in Spain. Answer clearly and confidently.

During the appointment, you'll pay the visa fee (typically €80-100, though exact amounts vary by consulate) and submit your biometric data (fingerprints and photo).

### Step 5: Await processing

Processing takes 20-60 days depending on the consulate's workload. Some consulates send your application to Madrid for final approval, adding time.

You may receive requests for additional documentation during processing. Respond promptly to avoid delays.

### Step 6: Collect your visa

Once approved, you'll receive notification to collect your passport with the visa sticker. This initial visa is typically valid for one year and permits entry to Spain.

### Step 7: Register in Spain

Within 30 days of arriving in Spain, complete these steps:

- **Register with local police**: Present your visa and receive your TIE (foreigner identity card).
- **Register at the town hall**: Complete [empadronamiento]({{ '/guides/empadronamiento-spain/' | relative_url }}) to receive your address certificate.
- **Activate health insurance**: Ensure your private insurance is active.
- **Open Spanish bank account**: Simplifies paying rent, utilities, and taxes.

## Processing times and costs

| Item | Timeline/Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Document gathering | 1-2 months |
| Apostille per document | €10-30 |
| Translation per document | €50-100 |
| Consulate appointment wait | 2-6 weeks |
| Visa processing | 20-60 days |
| Visa fee | €80-100 |
| Health insurance | €50-150/month |
| NIE fee | €9.84 |
| Legal assistance (optional) | €500-1,500 |

Total estimated cost for a single applicant: €1,000-2,500, excluding health insurance. Add €500-800 for each dependent family member.

Many applicants hire immigration lawyers to ensure document accuracy and handle communications with consulates. While not mandatory, professional assistance reduces rejection risk and stress.

## Tax implications: Beckham Law benefits

Taxation is a crucial consideration for digital nomads in Spain. Understanding your obligations helps you plan finances and potentially save significant money.

### Tax residency

You become a Spanish tax resident if you spend more than 183 days per year in Spain or if Spain becomes your primary economic interest base. Tax residents pay Spanish income tax on worldwide income at rates from 19% to 47%.

For digital nomads earning €50,000-100,000 annually, standard Spanish tax rates can significantly impact net income. This is where the Beckham Law becomes valuable.

### Beckham Law (Ley Beckham)

The Beckham Law offers special tax treatment for new residents moving to Spain for work. Instead of progressive rates on worldwide income, you pay:

- **24% flat rate** on Spanish-source income up to €600,000.
- **Exemption** on most foreign-source income and capital gains (with some exceptions).

This can result in substantial tax savings. For example, a digital nomad earning €60,000 remotely from a US company would pay approximately €14,400 under the Beckham Law versus €18,000-22,000 under standard Spanish rates.

### Qualifying for the Beckham Law

To qualify:

1. You haven't been a Spanish tax resident in the previous ten years.
2. You move to Spain for work reasons (the Digital Nomad Visa qualifies).
3. You apply within six months of obtaining Spanish tax residency.
4. Your application is submitted via Form 149.

The regime lasts six years and covers your spouse and minor children. After six years, you transition to standard Spanish tax rates.

### Social security contributions

As a digital nomad working remotely, you're typically not required to register with Spanish Social Security unless you work for Spanish clients exceeding the 20% threshold. However, registering as autónomo (self-employed) may be required depending on your specific situation. Consult a Spanish tax advisor to clarify your obligations.

### Double taxation treaties

Spain has tax treaties with most countries to prevent double taxation. US citizens,
