Registering with Spain’s **Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social (TGSS)** is essential for accessing public healthcare, employment benefits, and pension contributions.

## Who needs a Spanish Social Security number

You must obtain a **Número de Seguridad Social (NUSS)** if you:

- Start employment with a Spanish company or register as autónomo.
- Want to access the public healthcare system after relocating to Spain.
- Sponsor dependants for healthcare coverage or family benefits.
- Apply for maternity, paternity, or unemployment support.

Non-EU residents usually complete this step immediately after receiving their NIE/TIE card. EU citizens can request the number before formal residency if they plan to work.

## Documents to prepare

Gather digital and paper copies of:

- Passport and NIE/TIE card.
- Empadronamiento certificate issued within the last three months.
- Employment contract, autónomo registration (Modelo TA.0521), or university enrolment letter.
- Completed **Modelo TA.1** application form.
- Social Security appointment confirmation (if applying in person).

Translate foreign documents into Spanish and add apostilles where required by your provincial TGSS office.

## How to apply in person

1. Book an appointment via the **Cita Previa** system on the Social Security website.
2. Select *Asignación Número Seguridad Social* as the appointment type.
3. Bring your TA.1 form, identification, and supporting documents.
4. Submit them at the TGSS office; you’ll receive your NUSS on the spot or via email the same day.

Tip: Arrive 15 minutes early to clear security and verify paperwork before your appointment window.

## How to apply online with Cl@ve

1. Activate **Cl@ve Permanente** or obtain a digital certificate (*certificado digital*) from FNMT.
2. Log into the TGSS portal and choose *Alta en Seguridad Social*.
3. Upload scanned copies of your TA.1, ID, and padrón certificate.
4. Submit the request; Social Security will issue your number via email, usually within 48 hours.

If you lack Cl@ve credentials, request an in-person identity verification appointment at the Post Office or TGSS office to finish the registration.

## Linking healthcare and employment benefits

- After receiving your NUSS, notify your employer or file autónomo registration to activate contributions.
- Visit your local **centro de salud** with the Social Security certificate to request a **Tarjeta Sanitaria Individual (TSI)**.
- Add dependants by submitting their documentation through the *Import@ss* portal or TGSS office.
- Update your data (address, phone, bank details) using *Import@ss* to keep records accurate for future benefits.

## Common issues and fixes

- **Duplicate numbers:** If you previously worked in Spain, request a certificate of affiliation instead of a new number.
- **Missing padrón:** Book empadronamiento quickly—many TGSS offices reject applications without proof of residence.
- **Expired passports:** Renew before applying; TGSS will not issue a NUSS with an expired document.
- **Appointment delays:** Check nearby towns for faster availability or visit during early-morning walk-in slots.

## FAQs

**Can students get a Social Security number?**
Yes. Provide your enrolment letter and internship or part-time contract to justify the application.

**Do freelancers need a Social Security number before registering as autónomo?**
You can submit the TA.1 and TA.0521 forms together; TGSS assigns the number and finalises your autónomo enrolment in one visit.

**Will my NUSS expire if I leave Spain?**
No. The number is permanent. Reactivate contributions when you return or start a new job.
