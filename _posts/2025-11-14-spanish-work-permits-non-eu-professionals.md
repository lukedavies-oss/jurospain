## Overview of Spanish work permits

Spain’s immigration law differentiates between **national law permits** processed by provincial extranjería offices and **special regimes** handled by the Large Companies and Strategic Collectives Unit (UGE-CE). The route you choose depends on salary, job classification, and whether the company is transferring staff internally.

## Highly Qualified Professional permit

The **Highly Qualified Professional (HQP)** permit targets managers, specialists, and graduates hired by large companies or strategic projects. Key points:

- Minimum salary threshold typically set at 1.5x the Spanish average for comparable roles.
- Employment contract must be indefinite or at least one year.
- Employer must demonstrate financial solvency and compliance with tax/social security obligations.
- Application is filed by the employer with UGE-CE and includes a copy of the employee’s degree or proof of experience.
- Initial residence is granted for up to three years and renewable for two-year periods.

## Intra-company transfer (ICT) permits

Multinationals can move staff to Spain under ICT rules:

- **ICT EU Blue Card** for managers and specialists posted for more than 90 days.
- **ICT National** for trainees or assignments that do not meet EU thresholds.
- Applicants must have worked for the sending company for at least three to nine months (depending on category).
- Transfer agreements should specify salary, duration, and location in Spain.
- Family members may apply for dependent residence simultaneously.

## General work permit (contingente general)

The traditional work permit requires a **labour market test** unless the role is on the shortage occupation list. Employers submit:

- Employment contract stamped by the Labour Office.
- Evidence of recruitment efforts in Spain/EU.
- Proof that the company is up to date with Hacienda and Social Security.

After approval, the worker applies for a visa at the Spanish consulate in their home country. Upon arrival, they register fingerprints to obtain the TIE card.

## Entrepreneur and startup visas

Spain’s **Ley de Startups** introduced streamlined permits for founders and remote executives:

- Submit a business plan demonstrating innovation, scalability, and job creation.
- Obtain a favourable report from ENISA or a recognised incubator.
- Show sufficient financial means to support yourself and dependants.
- Permits are issued for up to three years with the possibility of permanent residence after five years.

## Document checklist

Prepare the following core items for most work permit filings:

- Valid passport with at least one year remaining.
- Legalised or apostilled academic qualifications.
- Curriculum vitae and proof of professional experience.
- Clean criminal record certificate for the previous five years.
- Private health insurance or proof of Spanish Social Security registration.
- Signed employment contract or transfer letter specifying salary and duties.

## Processing times and renewals

- UGE-CE decisions often arrive within 20 business days; silence implies approval.
- Provincial extranjería timelines vary by region, averaging 2–3 months.
- Once approved, visas must be collected within one month and you must enter Spain within the visa validity.
- Submit renewal requests at least 60 days before expiration, providing updated contracts and Social Security history.

## FAQs

**Can I switch employers under the HQP permit?**
Yes, but notify UGE-CE and provide the new contract to maintain compliance.

**Do work permits allow remote work for foreign companies?**
Generally no. Choose the Digital Nomad Visa if your employer remains outside Spain.

**Can dependants work?**
Spouses and adult children may request work authorisation once in Spain, subject to local labour rules.
