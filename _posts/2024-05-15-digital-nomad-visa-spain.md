## Why Spain launched the digital nomad visa

Spain’s 2023 Startup Law introduced a long-awaited visa and residence permit for remote workers. The goal: attract high-skilled professionals, entrepreneurs, and freelancers who can contribute to Spain’s innovation ecosystem without taking local jobs. The visa grants an initial one-year stay (or three-year residence permit when applying from Spain), with renewals leading to a five-year residence horizon. For expats, it offers a structured way to work legally while enjoying Spain’s lifestyle, affordable cost of living, and strong infrastructure.

## Who is eligible in 2025

To qualify you must:

- Hold a university degree or have at least three years of professional experience relevant to your remote work.
- Demonstrate an employment or freelance relationship with non-Spanish companies established at least one year prior to application.
- Prove that you can work remotely using digital tools and that your role can be performed from Spain.
- Have a clean criminal record for the past five years.
- Carry private health insurance authorised in Spain.
- Meet income thresholds for yourself and any dependants.

Freelancers must show contracts with international clients and evidence that no more than 20% of revenue comes from Spanish clients. Employees need a letter from their company confirming remote work capability, role details, and salary.

## Income thresholds and financial evidence

As of 2025, the income requirements are tied to Spain’s minimum wage (SMI). You must show:

- **Main applicant:** 200% of SMI (€2,520 per month).
- **First dependant (spouse or partner):** +75% of SMI (€945 per month).
- **Each additional dependant:** +25% of SMI (€315 per month).

Evidence can include employment contracts, payslips, bank statements, tax returns, or invoices. Combine several sources to present a consistent financial story. If your income is variable, average the last six months and include proof of ongoing projects.

## Documents checklist

Prepare these documents, translating them into Spanish with sworn translators where necessary:

- Passport valid for at least one year and copies of all pages.
- Clean criminal record certificates from countries where you have lived in the past five years, legalised or apostilled.
- Proof of professional experience or academic qualifications.
- Employment letter or freelance contracts detailing remote work, duration, role, and salary.
- Bank statements covering the last three to six months.
- Private health insurance certificate with full coverage in Spain.
- CV outlining your work history and digital skills.
- Completed application forms (national visa form or residency form depending on the route).

Double-check consulate-specific requirements, as some request additional forms or translations.

## How to apply from abroad

1. **Gather documents and translations.** Start at least two months before your planned move.
2. **Book an appointment** at the Spanish consulate in your home country. Some consulates accept postal applications, but most require in-person submissions.
3. **Submit the visa application** with the national visa form, supporting documents, and visa fee (around €80). Your passport remains with the consulate during processing.
4. **Receive the visa** valid for one year. After arriving in Spain, apply for the three-year residence card within 30 days by booking a fingerprint appointment at the police station.

## How to apply from within Spain

If you are already in Spain on a tourist visa or another short-term stay, you can apply directly for the three-year residence permit (teletrabajo de carácter internacional) without leaving the country:

1. **Prepare documents** as above, ensuring your stay is still legal when you submit.
2. **Submit the application electronically** through the UGE-CE platform with a digital certificate or via a legal representative. Pay the government fee (~€73).
3. **Await resolution.** The administration has 20 working days to respond. Silence means approval by default.
4. **Book fingerprints** once approved to obtain the TIE card. The residence permit is valid for three years.

## Processing timelines and fees

- **Consulate applications:** 15–45 days depending on workload. You receive a one-year visa.
- **In-country applications:** 20 working days for resolution; actual timing may be faster if your file is complete.
- **Fees:** Around €80 at consulates plus the €73 residence fee in Spain. Fingerprint appointments incur an additional €16 card issuance fee.

Plan for longer timelines during peak summer months and before year-end holidays.

## Tax considerations and the Beckham Law

Digital nomads often worry about tax residency. If you spend more than 183 days per calendar year in Spain, you become a tax resident. However, you can apply for the **Beckham Law** (special impatriate regime) within six months of registering with Social Security or obtaining the residence card. Benefits include:

- Flat 24% tax on Spanish-source income up to €600,000.
- No taxation on worldwide income except employment income paid by foreign employers.
- Exemption from wealth tax on non-Spanish assets.

Requirements include not having been a tax resident in Spain during the previous five years and having an employment contract with a foreign company. Freelancers can qualify if they register as administrators of a Spanish company created for their activity. Consult a tax advisor to model whether the regime suits your situation. Without the Beckham Law, expect progressive tax rates up to 47% on worldwide income.

## Healthcare, social security, and dependants

Private health insurance must offer comprehensive coverage with no co-payments. Once in Spain, you can voluntarily register with Social Security to access the public healthcare system, especially if you plan to stay long term. Employees who remain on foreign payroll may continue contributing to their home-country social security under bilateral agreements.

Dependants (spouse, partner, minor children, and dependent adult children) can join your application if you meet the higher income threshold. Each dependant submits their own forms, health insurance, and criminal records (if over 18). They receive residence cards with the same validity as the main applicant and can work in Spain.

## Renewals and pathway to permanent residency

The initial residence permit lasts three years. To renew for two more years:

- Maintain the remote work relationship or international client portfolio.
- Continue meeting income thresholds and holding private health insurance.
- Prove you have spent more than six months per year in Spain if you aim for long-term residence.

After five years of residence, you can request long-term EU residence, granting the right to live and work in Spain indefinitely. After ten years (or two years for many Latin American citizens), you can apply for citizenship by naturalisation, subject to language and civic exams.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Submitting incomplete financial evidence.** Provide payslips, bank statements, and employer letters to prove consistent income.
- **Ignoring apostille requirements.** Criminal records and academic certificates must be legalised and translated.
- **Missing application deadlines.** If applying from within Spain, submit before your 90-day stay ends.
- **Overlooking tax planning.** Decide early whether to apply for the Beckham Law and coordinate payroll accordingly.
- **Working with Spanish clients beyond the limit.** Track revenue sources to stay under the 20% cap.

## FAQs

### Can I switch from the digital nomad visa to another permit?

Yes. Many remote workers transition to the [autónomo regime]({{ '/guides/register-as-autonomo-spain/' | relative_url }}) or to company-sponsored work permits if they take local employment. Your time on the digital nomad visa counts toward long-term residency.

### Can I travel within the Schengen Area?

Yes. The visa grants freedom of movement throughout Schengen countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, similar to other Spanish residence permits.

### Do I need to register as autónomo?

Employees working for foreign companies do not. Freelancers may need to register if they invoice Spanish clients or spend significant time in Spain. Discuss your case with a tax advisor.

### What happens if my remote job ends?

You must inform immigration authorities and either find new qualifying employment or change to another residence permit. Having savings and backup clients helps you remain compliant during transitions.
