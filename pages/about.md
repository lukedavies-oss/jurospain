## Our story

Juro Spain was born when a group of relocation consultants and a Madrid-based partner lawyer noticed how many international families were juggling fragmented advice. We decided to build a boutique, English-first practice that treats every move as a project with milestones, owners, and proactive communication.

## What we believe in

- **Clarity before paperwork.** We translate Spanish legal steps into plain English roadmaps.
- **Quality partners.** From notaries to tax advisors, we only collaborate with vetted professionals.
- **Momentum.** Immigration and property timelines move fast—we keep every file on track.

## Meet your core team

- **Elena Martín — Partner lawyer.** Spanish-qualified attorney focused on immigration and property transactions.
- **Chris Walker — Client lead.** UK-born relocation specialist who has lived in Spain for a decade.
- **Ana López — Case manager.** Coordinates appointments, sworn translations, and document logistics.

## Trusted nationwide

We operate remotely across Spain, with in-person support in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Málaga, and Alicante through our partner network.

## How we work with you

1. **Discovery call.** Understand your goals, timeline, and budget.
2. **Strategy pack.** A written plan with requirements, costs, and deadlines.
3. **Execution.** We prepare documents, attend appointments, and keep you updated.
4. **Settlement support.** Beyond the first milestone, we assist with renewals, utilities, and ongoing compliance.
